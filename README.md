# Feature-Crosses
 
## Improve a linear regression model with the addition of additional synthetic features (this is a continuation of the previous exercise)
## Use an input function to convert pandas DataFrame objects to Tensors and invoke the input function in fit() and predict() operations
## Use the FTRL optimization algorithm for model training
## Create new synthetic features through one-hot encoding, binning, and feature crosses
